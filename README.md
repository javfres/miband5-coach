# miband5-coach

This is a web application that connects to a MiBand5
to show the heart beats during exercise.
I use it to monitor myself while using a stationary bicy.
You can set a execise time and a target bps and it
will show colors.

This uses vue and typescript.
It uses the bluetooth api that you will need to enable in the browser.
Moreover, you need the authkey for the band,
that can be obtaining with some 3ยบ party app.
